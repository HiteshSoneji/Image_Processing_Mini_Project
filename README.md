# OCR for Typed and Handwritten Images
 This was part of our Image Processing Course. We used Python to create the OCR. With the help of Opencv Library of python and KNN Machine Learning Algorithm we have created this project. The testing data consists of 2 images for typed letters + numbers and 6 images for handwritten letters + numbers.
